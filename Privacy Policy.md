### **Introduction**

Welcome to the Vidu AI Bot! Our mission is to provide you with powerful and fun tools to create AI-generated videos and audio directly on Discord. This Privacy Policy is a detailed guide to explain what information we collect, how we use it, and how we protect it. We believe in transparency, and we want you to feel secure and informed when using our services.

By inviting or using the Vidu AI Bot in a Discord server, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

### **Section 1: The Information We Collect**

To make the bot work, we need to collect a small amount of information. We are committed to collecting only what is essential for the bot's features.

**1.1. What information does the bot collect automatically?**

- **Your Discord User ID:** This is your unique numerical identifier on Discord (e.g., `816721256790753362`). We use this as a "name tag" to distinguish you from other users.
    - **Why we need it:** To manage your personal settings (like language), track your monthly free generations, and apply moderation actions if necessary.
- **Server (Guild) ID:** The unique numerical identifier for the Discord server where you are using the bot.
    - **Why we need it:** To enable server-specific features and know where our bot is being used.
- **Channel ID:** The unique numerical identifier for the channel where a command is used.
    - **Why we need it:** To respond in the correct channel and for features that are restricted to specific channels (like our "smart channels").

**1.2. What information do you provide to us directly?**

- **Command Content (Prompts & Media):** When you use a command like `/t2v` or `/i2v`, you provide us with text (a "prompt") and sometimes images or other media.
    - **Why we need it:** This is the core material the AI needs to generate your video or audio. We process this content to fulfill your request. We do not store your uploaded images long-term.
- **Generation and Task Logs:** To improve our service quality and provide better support, we maintain comprehensive logs of all generation tasks, including:
    - Text prompts and uploaded images
    - Generation settings (model, duration, resolution, etc.)
    - Success/failure status and error messages
    - Processing times and system performance data
    - Generated content metadata and download links
    - **Important:** These detailed logs are automatically deleted after 90 days and are used solely for service improvement, debugging, and understanding usage patterns.
- **User Settings:** When you change a setting, like your preferred language, we store that choice so the bot can remember it for you.

**1.3. What information does the bot absolutely NOT collect?**

We want to be crystal clear about what we **do not** do. We will **never** collect or store:

- Your Discord email address or password.
- Your IP address.
- Your direct messages (DMs) with other users.
- Any messages in a server that are not a direct command to our bot or do not trigger our safety filters. We are not monitoring your conversations.

### **Section 2: How We Use Your Information**

Here is a detailed breakdown of why we need the information we collect.

**2.1. To Provide the Bot's Core Services:**

- **AI Content Generation:** Your prompts and uploaded images are sent to our AI partners (Vidu API, Google Vision API, Groq API) to create the content you requested. This is the primary function of the bot.
- **Monthly Usage Limits:** Vidu is free to use up to a certain limit each month. We use your Discord User ID to count how many videos, audio files, and templates you've created to ensure fair usage for everyone. Your limits reset automatically at the beginning of each month.
- **Personalization:** We use your stored settings to have the bot respond to you in your preferred language.

**2.2. To Ensure a Safe Community (Content Moderation):**

- **Why do we moderate content?** To create a safe and welcoming environment for all users, free from harassment, hate speech, and inappropriate content.
- **How does it work?** In servers where administrators have enabled this feature, the bot uses its **Message Content Intent** to check the text of messages against a list of prohibited words. If a match is found, the message is automatically deleted, and a warning may be issued.
- **Image Safety:** When you upload an image, we use the **Google Vision API** to check if it contains unsafe content (like adult material or violence). If it does, the command will be blocked.
- **Is this active everywhere?** No. This feature is **only active in selected servers** that have been specifically configured for it. In all other servers, the bot does not read or moderate message content.

**2.3. For Administration and Bot Health:**

- **Admin Dashboard:** A pre-defined list of selected, only bot administrators has access to a dashboard to manage the bot. They can adjust content filters and view general usage statistics (e.g., "the `/t2v` command was used 500 times today") to ensure the bot is running smoothly.
- **Comprehensive Task Logging:** We maintain detailed logs of all generation tasks across two specialized logging channels (success logs and failed logs) to:
    - Monitor real-time service performance and identify issues quickly
    - Analyze usage patterns to improve service quality and optimize resources
    - Debug failed generations and provide better user support
    - Track system performance metrics and error rates
- **Troubleshooting and Support:** When technical issues occur, administrators can review relevant logs to diagnose problems and provide assistance. All Task logs are retained for 90 days maximum and then automatically deleted.

### **Section 3: Data Sharing with Third Parties**

We do not sell your data. We only share it when necessary to make the bot work.

- **AI Generation Partners:**
    - **Vidu API:** For video and audio generation.
    - **Google Vision API:** For checking image safety.
    - **Groq API:** For enhancing your text prompts with the `/enhance` command.
- **Legal Compliance:** We will only share data if required by law or a valid legal process.

We only send the minimum information required for these services to function (e.g., the prompt or the image). We do not send your Discord username or User ID along with these requests.

### **Section 4: Data Storage, Security, and Retention**

- **Storage:** The limited data we collect is stored in configuration files on a secure server.
- **Security:** We take reasonable technical measures to protect your data from unauthorized access.
- **Retention:** We only keep your data for as long as necessary.
    - **Usage Data:** Retained to manage your monthly limits.
    - **Generation Task Logs:** All comprehensive logs including prompts, images, generation settings, results, and performance data are automatically deleted after 90 days. This retention period allows us to effectively debug issues, improve service quality, and understand usage patterns while respecting your privacy.
    - **Moderation Logs:** Retained for a period for server safety and accountability.
    - **Generated Content:** We do not permanently store the videos or audio you create. The download links provided may expire after a certain period.

### **Section 5: Your Rights and How to Control Your Data**

You are in control of your information.

- **Accessing Your Data:** You can request a copy of the data associated with your User ID by contacting us.
- **Deleting Your Data:** You can request the deletion of your data. Please note that this will permanently reset your usage history, settings, and any accumulated bonus generations.
- **Managing Bot Permissions (for Server Admins):** If you are a server administrator, you control what the bot can do. You can disable its ability to read messages in any channel by adjusting its permissions in your server settings.

### **Section 6: Contact Us**

If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding your privacy, please don't hesitate to reach out. The best way to contact us is through our official Discord support server.
