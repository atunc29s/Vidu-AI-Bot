To use the Vidu Bot, you must:

- Be at least 13 years old or the minimum age required to use Discord in your country.
- Have a valid Discord account in good standing.
- Agree to these Terms of Service.

When you use a command for the first time, you will be prompted to agree to these Terms. Your agreement creates a binding contract between you and Vidu.

### **3. Acceptable Use Policy**

### **4. Content Ownership and Rights**

- **Your Content:** You retain ownership of the original prompts you write and the images you upload ("Your Input").
- **Generated Content:** You are free to use the videos and audio you create ("Generated Content") for personal, non-commercial purposes, in compliance with these Terms. For commercial use, please contact us for licensing information.
- **Our License to Use:** By using the Bot, you grant Vidu a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, and display Your Input and the Generated Content for the purposes of operating, improving, and troubleshooting the Bot. For example, we may use content to debug a failed generation or improve our AI models. We will never use your content for marketing without your explicit permission.
- **Data Logging and Retention:** To improve our service quality and understand usage patterns, we maintain comprehensive logs of generation tasks, including prompts, images, generated content, and system performance data. These logs are automatically deleted after 90 days and are used solely for service improvement, debugging, and analytics purposes.
- **Responsibility:** You are solely responsible for the content you generate and how you use it. Vidu is a tool, and we are not liable for any consequences arising from the content you create.

### **5. Service Usage and Limitations**

- **Free Tier:** Vidu provides a limited number of free content generations to each user per month. These limits are subject to change and will be communicated within the Bot.
- **Resource Management:** To ensure a stable experience for all users, you may only run one generation task at a time.
- **Service Availability:** We strive to keep the Bot operational 24/7, but we do not guarantee uninterrupted service. The Bot may be unavailable due to maintenance, technical issues, or other factors.

### **6. Data Collection and Logging**

To provide, maintain, and improve our service, we collect and temporarily store the following information:

- **Generation Logs:** Complete records of all generation tasks including prompts, uploaded images, model settings, generation results, and timestamps.
- **Task Performance Data:** Processing times, success/failure rates, error messages, and system performance metrics.
- **User Interaction Data:** Command usage patterns, feature utilization statistics, and service interaction history.

**Data Retention:** All logged data is automatically deleted after 90 days from the date of collection. This retention period allows us to:

- Debug and resolve technical issues
- Analyze usage patterns to improve service quality
- Monitor system performance and optimize resources
- Ensure compliance with our Acceptable Use Policy

**Data Security:** We implement appropriate security measures to protect logged data during the retention period. Access to logs is restricted to authorized team members for legitimate service improvement purposes only.

In servers where our moderation features are enabled by administrators, the Vidu Bot will automatically scan message content and images to enforce our Acceptable Use Policy.

- If your message or image violates our policies, it may be automatically deleted.
